                time seriously, yet believe in keeping the game enjoyable for
                all.

                <b class="text-uppercase cyan--text">Templar</b> - Raiders that
                officers believe go above and beyond our expectations for the
                good of the raid and the guild. Officers regularly discuss
                raider candidacy for the Templar rank; don't ask us if you
                qualify, we'll tell you when we promote you!

                <b class="text-uppercase cyan--text">Crusaders</b> - Raiders who
                have passed their trial period and maintain attendance and
                performance requirements.
              </p>
              <p class="text font-weight-light">
                <b class="text-uppercase cyan--text">Acolytes</b> - These are
                raiders that fall into two categories watched by the officers.
                Members currently starting their trial period, or raiders who
                have fallen below the attendance and/or performance requirements
                of a crusader.
              </p>
              <p class="text font-weight-light">
                Holding a higher rank doesn't mean you won't be sat; if an
                Acolyte is outperforming a Crusader, the latter will be benched.

                The minimum attendance requirements are dependent on rank and
                raider status (current raider or trial member). If you fall
                below the attendance requirement for your rank, you have a grace
                period of 6 consecutive raid nights to return to the rank's
                minimum. Failing to return to your rank's minimum will result in
                a rank demotion. Our leniency will depend on your history of
                notifying us of absences, and we will obviously take emergencies
                and disasters into consideration.

                With the changes to the loot system in Dragonflight, the guild
                has adopted RC Loot Council to help us manage loot distribution.
                All raiders are required to have this addon installed.
              </p>
              <p class="text font-weight-light">
                We use the following settings to distribute loot, in terms of
                priority:
              </p>
              <ol class="text font-weight-light my-6">
                <li>Mainspec BIS (mythic raid only)</li>
                <li>Mainspec Need</li>
                <li>Mainspec Greed (sidegrades)</li>
                <li>Offspec Need</li>
                <li>Offspec Greed</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text font-weight-light">
                Officers make the final determination for awarding loot based on
                other factors like completing 2 or 4-set for tier, item level
                upgrades, performance, and attendance.

                BoEs are the primary source of funding for the guild bank to
                provide consumables such as cauldrons and feasts, in addition to
                repairs. Raiders must trade to an officer any such BoEs acquired
                during one of our officially scheduled raids before the end of
                the raid. If a raider desires to purchase a BoE from the guild,
                they are offered at 30% off the current AH price.
